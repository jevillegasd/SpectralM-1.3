# SpectralM-1.3
 Matlab based Interface with Keysight instruments.

Driver free communication with Keysight Optical isntruments. This platform is sepcifically designed to interact with Tunable Laser Mainframes, Optical Power Meters and ATtenuators from Keysight (HP - Agilent). It may connect with the instruments using GPIB or Ethernet interfaces (USB is not suported).

## To do
- There is no documentation yet.
- Drivers are basically embedded in the functions called to interface with the instruments, this could be avoided by creating classes that act as the device drivers or using configuration lookup tables to determine the commands to interface with the isntruments
